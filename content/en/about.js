  <p>
    My name is Francisco Javier, although everybody knows me as Javi.
    Since I was a child I am passionate about computers and any technological
    device. The first day that I code I knew that I wanted to continue
    programing for the rest of my life; if my biggest hobby becomes my job it
    will be a dream come true.

    However, my relationship with face-to-face training was not as good as I
    would liked; at one point in my life, I dropped out of school and started
    studying on my own what really excited me: computer science, and more
    specifically programming and management of GNU/Linux operating systems.
    This was a blip in my professional career, but also made me a self-taught
    person who quickly finds a solution to the problems that may come during
    the development of projects or setting up a new service on servers.

    After leaving school I was working on several jobs, not related to
    computers, in order to get money… but I did not see myself working on any
    of them for my whole life. Having assumed that, I went back to studying,
    performing all the intermediate necessary steps to achieve the real goal:
    get the Multi-platform Applications Development Higher National Diploma
    (EQF level 5), it means being able to justify in my CV that I really know
    what I know without needing someone to trust my word.

  internet: `
  <p>
    My first steps on the internet started around the year 2000.
    At the beginning I did the same things as everyone: discover what the
    internet means, join chats to meet people, spend some time in the missing
    MSN Messenger, and so on. I started to take internet more seriously around
    2003; together with some friends we started some projects, which for one
    reason or another never became a success… perhaps the lack of experience
    and youth of all the partners had something to do. It was at the end of
    2004 when I decided to have my own website. At that time I did not know
    anything about web pages, but despite that, I created my first weblog.
    It was hosted until May 2007 on the servers of Geanostrum, one of those
    projects I mentioned before, which was not a success but allowed me to
    learn many things (I installed and configured my first network services:
    email server, jabber server, IRC server, streaming radio servers,
    I programmed my first bots, I met the C language…) and all of this on one
    of my home computers.
