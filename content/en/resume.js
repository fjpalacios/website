      Hi! Everyone knows me as <strong>Javi</strong> and I'm a techie.
      Since I was a kid I've been passionate about computers and generally any
      technological device. Since I started programming as a child I knew I
      wanted to continue doing it for the rest of my life; if I can also turn
      my greatest hobby into my profession it will be a dream come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my personal projects I've applied most of the best practices
      recommended in <em>Extreme Programming Explained</em>, by Kent Beck;
      also the knowledge acquired by reading <em>Clean Code</em>, by
      Robert C. Martin and <em>Refactoring</em> by Martin Fowler and Kent Beck.
      I totally share the idea of writing code you can be proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a self-taught person, and with my academic background, I feel ready
      to work in a team using current technologies with a focus on good practices.
      My main characteristic is the passion for what I do and the desire to
      learn something new every day.
    </p>
