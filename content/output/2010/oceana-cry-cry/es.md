When she was a young girl, she used to play with me, I was her best friend, we were inseparately, we loved to ride our bikes, playin’ hide and seek, sneeking all the night, dancing in the street, I look back at the time, now I realise, she loved to play with fire, I should have seen it in her eyes... I should have seen it in her eyes...

Deep inside, you cry cry cry, don’t let your hopes, die die die, deep inside, you cry cry cry, Don’t let your hopes, die die die.

Na na, na na, na, na, na... Na na, na na, na, na, na...

She fell in love for the first time, he was older than her. Then he made her do things, first she wouldn’t dare. She left everything behind, couldn’t find a place, running through the night, loosing all her faith. She throws away the pain, turning off her lies, but still he makes her see like everything’s alright... Like everything’s alright...

Deep inside, you cry cry cry, don’t let your hopes, die die die, deep inside, you cry cry cry, don’t let your hopes, die die die, deep inside, you cry cry cry, don’t let your hopes, die die die.

Na na, na na, na, na, na... Na na, na na, na, na, na...

**Simplemente genial, ¿no?** :D
