**Charles John Huffam Dickens** (Portsmouth, England, United Kingdom, 1812 — Higham, Kent, England, United Kingdom, 1870) was a prominent English writer and novelist, one of the most well-known in world literature, and the most outstanding of the Victorian era. He was a master of the narrative genre, to which he added certain doses of humor and irony, while practicing sharp social criticism. His work stands out for its descriptions of people and places, both real and imaginary. On occasions, he used the pseudonym **Boz**. At the age of twelve, his father's imprisonment for debt forced him to work in a blacking factory. His education was irregular: he taught himself shorthand, worked as an assistant in a lawyer's office, and eventually became a parliamentary correspondent for the _Morning Chronicle_. His articles, later collected in _Sketches by Boz_ (1836–1837), were very successful, and with the appearance of <BookLink title="The Pickwick Papers" full={true} /> (1836–1837), Dickens became a true publishing phenomenon. Novels such as <BookLink title="Oliver Twist" full={true} /> (1837–1839), <BookLink title="Nicholas Nickleby" full={true} /> (1838–1839), or <BookLink title="Barnaby Rudge" full={true} /> (1841) achieved enormous popularity, as did some travel chronicles, such as _Pictures from Italy_ (1846). With <BookLink title="Dombey and Son" full={true} /> (1846–1848) he began his mature period, of which good examples are <BookLink title="David Copperfield" full={true} /> (1849–1850), his first novel in the first person and his favorite, in which he developed some autobiographical episodes; <BookLink title="Bleak House" full={true} /> (1852–1853); <BookLink title="Little Dorrit" full={true} /> (1855–1857), <BookLink title="A Tale of Two Cities" full={true} /> (1859), <BookLink title="Great Expectations" full={true} /> (1860–1861), and <BookLink title="Our Mutual Friend" full={true} /> (1864–1865).
