**Dolores Redondo Meira** (San Sebastián, Biscay, Spain, 1969) is a Spanish crime fiction writer. She began her literary career writing short stories and children's tales. In 2009 she published her first novel, <BookLink title="Los privilegios del ángel" /> (The Privileges of the Angel), and in January 2013 she published <BookLink title="El guardián invisible" /> (The Invisible Guardian), the first volume of the Baztán Trilogy, followed in November of the same year by the second part titled <BookLink title="Legado en los huesos" /> (The Legacy of the Bones), and completed in November 2014 with <BookLink title="Ofrenda a la tormenta" /> (Offering to the Storm). The trilogy has sold more than 700,000 copies and has been translated into over 15 languages. German producer Peter Nadermann, responsible for the film adaptations of <AuthorLink name="Stieg Larsson" />'s Millennium saga, acquired the film rights almost immediately after the first novel was published, and in 2017, the film *The Invisible Guardian*, based on the first novel of the trilogy, was released. She is the winner of the 2016 Premio Planeta for the manuscript of <BookLink title="Todo esto te daré" />, submitted to the contest under the pseudonym Jim Hawkins with the false title *Sol de Tebas* (Sun of Thebes).
