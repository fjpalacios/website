synopsis: "This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death. A patient escapes from a biological testing facility, unknowingly carrying a deadly weapon: a mutated strain of super-flu that will wipe out 99% of the world's population. Those who remain are scared, bewildered, and in need of a leader. Two emerge—Mother Abagail, the benevolent 108-year-old woman who urges them to build a peaceful community in Boulder, Colorado; and Randall Flagg, the nefarious 'Dark Man,' who delights in chaos and violence."

In my challenge to read all <AuthorLink name="Stephen King" /> books in order of publication (as much as possible at least), the next one on the list was this one, **_The Stand_**, and I was really looking forward to reading it. In my opinion, along with <BookLink title="It, by Stephen King" full={true} /> (1986), these are two of Stephen King's most iconic and well-known books. However, my fear of reading it was directly proportional to how much I wanted to read it—it's one of those books that receives all kinds of reviews, both good and bad, especially about the ending; and the bad ones tend to be quite harsh... I understand that after reading almost 1,200 pages, if you don't like the ending, you're justified in criticizing both the book and the author... so although I kept them in mind, I didn't pay too much attention to them and, as they say: onward.

I want to make it clear that I really liked the book... I loved it. It's an excellent book, though not suitable for people just starting to read, nor for those who, despite having been reading regularly for some time, haven't yet read several books by this author to get an idea of how he writes and what most of his books are like. In this book, it's much more evident than in others that Stephen King prioritizes, metaphorically speaking, the journey over the final destination.

Stephen King's book setups tend to be captivating—he describes the setting and characters masterfully, in a way few authors can manage; the development tends to be inconsistent, like when you go to an amusement park where there's an attraction that's going to send your adrenaline through the roof, but until you get to that point, the machine you're riding on takes a rather dull journey to gain enough distance and subsequent speed to reach the epic moment as quickly as possible and make that scene stick in your brain as long as possible... and right after that moment, back to the beginning, because if there's a double (or triple) serving of that frantic part, it'll be even better; and usually the ending drops off a bit... in some cases rallying a bit at the end, and in others falling completely and leaving you with a bittersweet feeling that the ending doesn't do justice to the rest of the book.

In a way, this one follows the pattern of most Stephen King books: the setup is sublime, we're introduced to _Captain Trips_ (as they call the flu virus) and the atrocities that can be seen throughout the United States because of it, we're introduced to countless characters, and for some of them, shortly after knowing who they are, what they do and where they're from, the author has an unpleasant death prepared for them, and little by little prominence is given to the cast of characters who will be accompanying us throughout the story.

### Characters

Although there are many characters, and as you get to know them you easily become attached to them, I'll only mention those I think are most representative of the story... and within them, only a brief selection of my favorites, otherwise I'd never finish.

**Nick Andros**: A deaf-mute young man whose communication difficulties are compensated by a mind capable of generating outstanding ideas and plans.

**Kojak**: This one's quick—I want a dog like him! That's it. Super fan.

**Harold Emery Lauder**: A key character who's extremely smart yet lacks judgment. Thanks to his ideas, other immune survivors were able to easily gather in the Boulder Free Zone.

**Frances "Frannie" Goldsmith**: The girl I felt the most sympathy for. She starts the Captain Trips story while pregnant, with circumstances working against her, yet despite everything that's happened in her life, she finds strength where you wouldn't expect it and pushes forward with everything. A great lesson.

**Glen Bateman**: An elderly sociologist who could perfectly fit the saying that he knows more from being old than from being clever. He's, along with Nick Andros, one of the great "thinking minds" of the Free Zone.

**Stuart "Stu" Redman**: One of the first characters to appear in this book who will accompany us throughout the plot. He perfectly embodies the role of peacemaker, a calm and fair man, which comes in handy during moments of uncertainty when any breakdown in harmony could cause chaos.

**Tom Cullen**: Another key character in the story.

**Mother Abagail Freemantle** and **Randall Flagg** head the good side and the bad side respectively in this story.

### Pros and Cons

My **pro** goes to the characterization of the characters. I know that in a King book this is predictable and it's like betting on a winning horse, but among the books I've been able to read by him so far, this one reflects this especially. Frannie, Harold, Larry, Glen, Stu, Nick, Tom, Nadine, Joe/Leo... I know each of them as if they were friends of mine for years! King gives them a personality that feels very real to me—there are no purely good or purely bad characters because in reality no one is 100% good or 100% bad, it depends on the occasion, and all these characters are perfectly known for both their strengths and weaknesses. I think it's a masterful construction of characters (so many and so varied among themselves).

Although it would be easy to give my **con** to the disproportionate length of the book, as I've seen in many reviews, I don't consider it to be so. However, I found a con that in my judgment carries more weight than the number of pages: the ending. And I'm not going crazy—I already said I liked it even though it wasn't what I expected... and right now I'll comment extensively on it, but despite liking it, I think an ending could easily have been put in line with the story that would have pleased many more people than the ending that was chosen, and I think that's a mistake on King's part.

### The Ending

As I said at the beginning: I liked the ending, although it wasn't what I expected. In case anyone doesn't know: two versions of this book have been written (the first pages of this volume clarify this point), the original and a later version that includes scenes that were in the original manuscript but that for budget reasons the publisher considered convenient to eliminate. In this extended version, there's a part at the end that's not included in the first version that could be read of this book and that makes that ending change radically from its predecessor. There will be spoilers.

The story of this novel focuses on the typical fight between good and evil; from the point when we're introduced to the heroine, Mother Abagail, and the antihero, the well-known Randall Flagg, it first becomes visible and then evident that Mother Abagail is sent to Earth by the good side, by God, and that Randall Flagg is sent to Earth by the bad side, by the Devil. <Spoiler>After such a long journey with the virus survivors, in the end it doesn't matter; the Boulder Free Zone is momentarily saved and can continue to exist and expand... but in the end that merit is achieved by a Randall Flagg error, the hand of God... or a mixture of both, without any of the characters we've accompanied during such a long journey having a say in the matter</Spoiler>.

Regarding the ending after the ending that's added in this version (not an alternative ending since it's just a brief chapter after the usual ending), I have to say I liked it, although I consider it a blunder and a deception for those who read the first version of this book... because it changes everything. <Spoiler>After that ending, in which everything seems to indicate that Randall Flagg dies (although it's not explicitly stated), this latest version adds a chapter in which Randall Flagg appears at a different point in the world with some natives who neither understand him nor know who he is, but he's already proposing to continue sowing chaos wherever he goes, as seen at the beginning of the book. That is: it's a few lines of text after the real ending but that completely changes the story; with the first ending, doubt remains, it's not known whether Flagg is dead or not and it can be understood that the good side beat the bad... with these final added lines, doubts are cleared and it's clear that evil always prevails</Spoiler>.
