If you've ever heard about Vim and wondered "why are so many people obsessed with a text editor from the 90s?", this course will give you the answer. Vim isn't just an editor: **it's a radically different way of thinking about text editing**. And once you understand its philosophy, you never want to go back.

Welcome to the **Mastering Vim from Scratch** course: a complete, free course that will take you from "how do I exit Vim?" to mastering Neovim with LazyVim, LSP, and professional workflows.

### Why learn Vim in 2026?

Vim has existed since 1991. Neovim, its modern successor, since 2014. **Why should you learn it now?**

1. **Brutal speed**: Once you master Vim, you edit text faster than with any other editor. It's not an exaggeration: it's physics. Your hands never leave the keyboard, no menus, no clicks. Just thought → action.

2. **It's everywhere**: Vim comes installed on practically all Unix/Linux systems. If you work with servers, containers, or remote systems, knowing Vim is a lifesaver.

3. **Neovim is modern**: Neovim isn't the Vim from the 90s. It's a 21st-century editor with LSP (autocomplete, go-to-definition, refactoring), tree-sitter (semantic highlighting), Lua (modern configuration), and a plugin ecosystem comparable to VS Code.

4. **LazyVim makes it accessible**: Configuring Neovim from scratch is complex. LazyVim is a preconfigured distribution that gives you a professional environment in minutes, without losing flexibility.

5. **Portability**: Your Vim/Neovim configuration is a set of text files. Copy them to any machine and you have your exact environment. You don't depend on proprietary software or cloud sync.

6. **Modal editing > traditional editing**: Once you understand Vim's modes (normal, insert, visual), you discover that other editors constantly waste your time alternating between writing text and modifying it.

### What makes this course different?

Most Vim tutorials fail because they:

- Overwhelm you with 200 commands on day one
- Don't explain Vim's **philosophy** (why it works this way)
- Use old Vim instead of modern Neovim
- Don't teach configuration or plugins

**This course is different:**

- **Progressive**: You start with the minimum ("how do I exit?") and build muscle memory step by step
- **Philosophy first**: You understand Vim's **grammar** (operator + motion) from the beginning
- **Neovim + LazyVim**: We teach you the Vim of 2026, not 1991
- **LSP and modern tools**: Autocomplete, diagnostics, formatting, debugger... everything you expect from a professional editor
- **Practical exercises**: Each lesson includes exercises to develop muscle memory

You won't learn "legacy Vim". You'll learn **Neovim with LazyVim, LSP, tree-sitter, and professional workflows** from day one (when you're ready).

### Why Neovim and not classic Vim

Vim (1991) is great, but Neovim (2014+) is **objectively better** for modern development:

- **Native LSP**: Autocomplete, go-to-definition, refactoring without heavy external plugins
- **Tree-sitter**: Semantic syntax highlighting (understands code, not just regex)
- **Lua**: Configuration in Lua (modern, fast) vs Vimscript (old, slow)
- **Async API**: Plugins don't block the editor
- **Active community**: Thousands of modern plugins, updated documentation
- **LazyVim**: Preconfigured distribution that saves you weeks of setup

If you had to learn Vim from scratch in 2026, **Neovim is the obvious choice**. And LazyVim gives you 90% of the work done.

### Is Vim hard to learn?

**Yes and no.**

Vim has a **steep learning curve**. The first few days you'll feel slow. You'll want to go back to VS Code. It's normal. We all went through that.

But the investment is worth it:

- **Week 1**: "This is horrible, I'm so slow"
- **Week 2**: "I'm starting to see why Vim exists..."
- **Week 3**: "Wait, this is incredibly efficient"
- **Month 2**: "How did I edit text before Vim?"
- **Month 3+**: "I've installed Vim extensions in my browser, IDE, terminal..."

The secret is **constant, progressive practice**. Don't try to learn everything at once. This course is designed for you to learn step by step, gradually building muscle memory.

### Do I need prior knowledge?

No. This course assumes **zero Vim knowledge**.

All you need:

- A computer (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL)
- Desire to learn a skill that will accompany you throughout your career
- Patience for the first few days (the learning curve is real)

If you already know how to program, great. If not, that's fine too: Vim is a tool for editing text, not just code. Writers, data analysts, system administrators... everyone benefits from Vim.

### The commitment I ask of you

Learning Vim requires **daily practice**. You can't learn it by reading: you have to **use your hands**.

My recommendation:

- **30 minutes daily** during the first 2 weeks (fundamentals)
- **Use Vim for EVERYTHING** (editing files, taking notes, writing code)
- **Don't quit in week 1** (it's the hardest)
- **Do the exercises** from each lesson (they build muscle memory)

If you follow the course consistently, in **one month you'll be competent in Vim**. In three months, **you'll master workflows most developers never know**.

### What this course is NOT

This course is **not**:

- ❌ A quick "10 Vim commands" tutorial
- ❌ A comparison of "Vim vs VS Code vs IntelliJ"
- ❌ A legacy Vim configuration guide (we use Neovim + LazyVim)
- ❌ Only for Linux users (works on macOS, Windows WSL)

This course **is**:

- ✅ A complete path from zero to professional
- ✅ Teaching of Vim's **philosophy** (not just commands)
- ✅ Modern configuration with Neovim, LazyVim and LSP
- ✅ Practical exercises for muscle memory
- ✅ Professional workflows (Git, testing, debugging)

### Additional resources

During the course, I'll recommend:

- **`:Tutor`** - Vim's interactive tutorial (30 well-invested minutes)
- **VimGolf** - Efficient editing exercises (like LeetCode for Vim)
- **Vim.so** - Vim practice generator
- **Dotfiles community** - Other users' configurations for inspiration

I'll also teach you to read **`:help`**, Vim's integrated documentation. It's your best friend when you have questions.

### Ready for the challenge?

If you've made it this far, you're probably already convinced (or at least curious). Learning Vim is **one of the most profitable investments you can make as a developer**. It's a skill that:

- Accompanies you throughout your career (30+ years and still going strong)
- Works in any environment (local, remote, containers, CI/CD)
- Makes you more productive (editing speed x2-x5 after mastering it)
- Is portable (your config goes with you to any machine)

The question isn't "should I learn Vim?" but "why didn't I learn it sooner?".
