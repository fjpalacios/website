Like we already explained in our first article for this course [What is Git?](/en/article/what-is-git/): Git is a decentralized service, you won't find the typical *client-server* kind of structure but with **remotes** we can emulate this method to which all of us are so used to.

### Remotes… What the heck are they?
As soon as we hear *Remote*, our mind flies to [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), which are perfect to emulate the mentioned structure and not only that, they are a great *showroom* for Open Source projects. 

A remote basically is another node where we can send data or where we can receive data from, another pc on our network, a colleague's pc or our company's main server.

Remote servers are in other terms a place where we can save a Backup (and many other things :P) exact same the way we have the data on our computers, but probably the most brighter side is when we are sending code to a service like GitHub or GitLab, takes out work from our side, as automatizes some tedious tasks, which cause serious time loss and nerves (above the sky!) and are (sometimes) the most hated tasks by devops like us. Executing our test battery for the new-ly sent code to GitHub is a perfect idea to make sure not even a single bracket is missing the closure or a function has stopped working since the implemented a new greeting method and the best of all, doing this is free! So why not give it a chance? 

### This this this is everything friends??
Nope, we are bringing more stuff about Git and the use of remotes in our following articles for this course.

And a quick reminder, all the code we are sharing with you is available in our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sargantanacode/git-tutorial) where you can access it and have an idea how Git works from a remote node perspective.

Meanwhile, as we always say… Never stop programming!
