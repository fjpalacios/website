Welcome to the world of programming! If you're reading this, it's because you've decided to take the leap and learn to code. And believe me: it's one of the best decisions you could make in 2026.

## What is programming?

**Programming is the art of giving precise instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks.** It's like writing a cooking recipe, but instead of preparing a cake, you're telling the computer what to do step by step.

Think about your daily life: when you use Instagram, when you search for something on Google, when you order food delivery, when you watch a series on Netflix... behind each of those actions, there are **thousands of lines of code** written by programmers like you (or like you'll soon be).

Programming isn't magic, nor is it "only for geniuses." **It's a skill learned through practice and patience**, like playing an instrument or speaking a new language.

## How do computers execute code?

Computers only understand one language: **binary code** (zeros and ones). But writing directly in binary would be madness. That's why **programming languages** exist: they allow us to write instructions in a way that's comprehensible to humans, and then those instructions are translated into machine code.

The simplified process is:

1. **You write code** in a programming language (like Python)
2. An **interpreter or compiler** translates that code into machine language
3. The **processor executes** the instructions

Python is an **interpreted** language, which means the code is translated and executed line by line in real-time. This makes it perfect for learning: you can see immediate results.

## What are programming languages?

A **programming language** is a set of rules and syntax that allows us to communicate with the computer. Just like in English we have grammar and vocabulary, in programming we have structures and keywords.

There are hundreds of programming languages, each designed for different purposes:

- **Python**: Web development, artificial intelligence, automation, data science
- **JavaScript**: Web development (frontend and backend)
- **Java**: Enterprise applications, Android
- **C/C++**: Operating systems, high-performance video games
- **Rust**: Low-level systems with high security
- **Go**: Scalable backend services

Each language has its strengths, but today, **Python is the most in-demand language in the market** for most modern applications.

## Why Python?

Python isn't just an excellent language for beginners. **It's the language used by Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, NASA, and thousands more companies** in production. You're not learning a "toy" language: you're learning the same tool that professionals use.

### Advantages of Python for beginners

**1. Clear and readable syntax**

Python is designed so that code resembles human language. Compare:

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
```

Versus other more verbose languages:

```java
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult");
}
```

**2. You don't need to worry about technical details at first**

Python automatically manages memory, data types, and many other aspects that in other languages you'd have to control manually.

**3. Gigantic ecosystem**

Python has **over 400,000 libraries** available for almost any task: from creating web pages to training artificial intelligence models.

**4. Extremely high job demand**

In 2026, Python is **the most sought-after language by companies** according to Stack Overflow, GitHub, and LinkedIn. Learning it opens doors.

**5. It can be used professionally**

Unlike purely educational languages, Python is used in production by:

- **Google** (YouTube, search engine)
- **Instagram** (entire backend)
- **Netflix** (recommendation systems)
- **Spotify** (data analysis)
- **Dropbox** (server and client)

### What can you do with Python?

The question should be: **what CAN'T you do with Python?**

- **Web development**: Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **Data science**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Automation**: Scripts for repetitive tasks
- **Testing and DevOps**: Pytest, Ansible
- **Video games**: Pygame
- **Desktop apps**: PyQt, Tkinter
- **Cybersecurity**: Ethical hacking and pentesting

## What you'll learn in this course

This isn't just any Python course. **You're going to learn Python as it's written in 2026 at professional companies**, not "basic" Python that you'll later have to unlearn.

Starting from lesson 17, once you have solid fundamentals, we'll introduce:

- **Static typing with mypy**: As done in production
- **Testing with pytest**: TDD from the beginning
- **Automatic formatting**: black, isort, flake8
- **Version management**: asdf for multiple Python versions
- **Best practices**: Clean and maintainable code

Don't worry if these terms don't ring a bell now. **We'll go step by step**, starting from absolute zero.

## What do you need to get started?

Only three things:

1. **A computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux, doesn't matter)
2. **Internet connection** (to download Python and install tools)
3. **Desire to learn** (the most important thing)

You don't need:

- ❌ To be a math genius
- ❌ Previous programming knowledge
- ❌ A powerful computer (Python works even on old computers)
- ❌ To pay anything (Python is free, this course is free)

## Next steps

In the next lesson, we'll install Python on your computer using **asdf**, a professional tool that will allow you to manage multiple Python versions (something you'll need when working on different projects).

After that, we'll write our first program: the classic "Hello, World!". It may seem simple, but it's a tradition in programming: we all start there.

## Key concepts from this lesson

- **Programming** is giving precise instructions to a computer
- **Programming languages** allow us to communicate with machines in a comprehensible way
- **Python** is an interpreted language with clear syntax and extremely high job demand
- This course will teach you **professional Python**, not just "basic Python"
- You don't need previous knowledge or to be a genius: **anyone can learn to program**
