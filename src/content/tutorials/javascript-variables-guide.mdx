# Getting Started with JavaScript Variables

Variables are one of the fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming. They allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data throughout your code.

## What is a Variable?

A variable is a named container that stores a value. Think of it like a labeled box where you can put things and retrieve them later.

```javascript
let userName = "John";
let userAge = 30;
let isActive = true;
```

## Three Ways to Declare Variables

JavaScript provides three keywords for declaring variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

### 1. let - Block-Scoped Variable

`let` is the modern way to declare variables that can change their value:

```javascript
let score = 0;
score = 10; // ✅ This works
score = 20; // ✅ This also works

if (true) {
  let innerScore = 5;
  console.log(innerScore); // ✅ 5
}
console.log(innerScore); // ❌ ReferenceError: innerScore is not defined
```

**Use `let` when:**
- The value will change over time
- The variable is only needed in a specific block of code

### 2. const - Constant Variable

`const` declares a variable whose value cannot be reassigned:

```javascript
const API_KEY = "abc123";
API_KEY = "xyz789"; // ❌ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

const user = { name: "John" };
user.name = "Jane"; // ✅ This works! Objects can be mutated
user = { name: "Bob" }; // ❌ But you can't reassign the variable
```

**Use `const` when:**
- The value shouldn't change (default choice)
- You want to prevent accidental reassignment

### 3. var - Legacy Variable (Avoid)

`var` is the old way of declaring variables. It has confusing scoping rules:

```javascript
var globalVar = "I'm global";

if (true) {
  var globalVar = "I'm still global"; // Same variable!
}

console.log(globalVar); // "I'm still global"
```

**⚠️ Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript.** Use `let` or `const` instead.

## Best Practices

1. **Use `const` by default** - Only use `let` when you know the value will change
2. **Use descriptive names** - `userName` is better than `un` or `x`
3. **Follow naming conventions** - Use camelCase for variables: `firstName`, `totalPrice`
4. **Declare variables at the top** - Makes your code easier to read
5. **One variable per line** - Avoid `let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;`

## Common Mistakes

### Forgetting to Declare

```javascript
score = 100; // ❌ Creates an implicit global variable (strict mode throws error)
let score = 100; // ✅ Properly declared
```

### Using Variables Before Declaration

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // ❌ ReferenceError with let/const
let myVar = "Hello";

console.log(myVar2); // undefined with var (hoisting)
var myVar2 = "Hello";
```

## Practice Exercise

Try creating variables for a simple user profile:

```javascript
const firstName = "John";
const lastName = "Doe";
let age = 30;
let isLoggedIn = false;

// Now try to:
// 1. Create a full name by combining firstName and lastName
// 2. Increment the age by 1
// 3. Toggle the isLoggedIn status
```

## Summary

- Use **`const`** for values that won't change
- Use **`let`** for values that will change
- Avoid **`var`** in modern JavaScript
- Always declare your variables
- Use meaningful, descriptive names

## Next Steps

Now that you understand variables, you're ready to learn about:
- Data types in JavaScript
- Operators and expressions
- Control flow (if/else statements)
