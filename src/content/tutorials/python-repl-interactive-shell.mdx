Now that you have Python installed on your system, it's time to discover one of the most useful tools for learning and experimenting: **the Python REPL**.

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**, and it's an interactive environment where you can write Python code and see the results immediately. Think of it as a sandbox where you can play with Python without creating files.

## What is the REPL?

The REPL is an interactive Python shell that:

1. **Reads** your Python code
2. **Evaluates** (executes) it
3. **Prints** the result
4. **Loops** back to wait for more code

It's perfect for:

- Testing small code snippets
- Learning Python syntax
- Exploring built-in functions
- Debugging quick ideas
- Performing calculations

## Starting the Python REPL

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
python
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
$ python
Python 3.12.0 (main, Oct  2 2023, 12:00:00)
[GCC 11.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

The `>>>` prompt means Python is ready to receive commands. You're now inside the REPL!

## Your First REPL Commands

Let's try some basic examples:

### Simple Calculations

```python
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 10 * 5
50
>>> 100 / 4
25.0
```

Notice how Python immediately shows you the result. No need to compile or run files.

### Printing Text

```python
>>> print("Hello from REPL!")
Hello from REPL!
>>> print("Python is awesome")
Python is awesome
```

### Variables

```python
>>> name = "Alice"
>>> name
'Alice'
>>> age = 25
>>> age
25
```

When you type a variable name, Python shows its value automatically.

## Built-in Helper Functions

The REPL comes with powerful helper functions:

### help() - Get Help on Anything

```python
>>> help(print)
Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

print(...)
    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
    ...
```

Press `q` to exit the help screen.

### dir() - Explore Available Methods

```python
>>> dir(str)
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', ..., 'upper', 'zfill']
```

This shows all the methods available for strings. Very useful when exploring!

### type() - Check Data Types

```python
>>> type(42)
<class 'int'>
>>> type("Hello")
<class 'str'>
>>> type(3.14)
<class 'float'>
```

## Multi-line Code in REPL

You can write multi-line code too. The prompt changes to `...` for continuation lines:

```python
>>> for i in range(3):
...     print(f"Number: {i}")
...
Number: 0
Number: 1
Number: 2
```

**Important**: After entering the code block, press Enter on an empty line (just `...` with nothing after) to execute it.

## Practical REPL Tips

### Tip 1: Use as a Calculator

```python
>>> # Calculate 15% tip on a $50 bill
>>> bill = 50
>>> tip = bill * 0.15
>>> total = bill + tip
>>> total
57.5
```

### Tip 2: Test String Methods

```python
>>> message = "hello world"
>>> message.upper()
'HELLO WORLD'
>>> message.title()
'Hello World'
>>> message.replace("world", "Python")
'hello Python'
```

### Tip 3: Quick Experiments

```python
>>> # Check if a number is even
>>> number = 42
>>> number % 2 == 0
True
```

## Special REPL Variables

The REPL has some special variables:

```python
>>> 10 + 5
15
>>> _
15
```

The underscore `_` holds the result of the last expression. Handy for quick follow-ups!

```python
>>> 100 / 3
33.333333333333336
>>> round(_, 2)
33.33
```

## Common REPL Gotchas

### 1. Indentation Matters

```python
>>> for i in range(3):
... print(i)  # ❌ IndentationError
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    print(i)
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

**Fix**: Always indent continuation lines with 4 spaces:

```python
>>> for i in range(3):
...     print(i)  # ✅ Correct
...
0
1
2
```

### 2. Empty Line to Execute Blocks

After writing loops or functions, press Enter on an empty line to execute:

```python
>>> for i in range(2):
...     print(i)
... [Press Enter here]
0
1
```

## Exiting the REPL

There are several ways to exit:

```python
>>> exit()
```

Or:

```python
>>> quit()
```

Or press `Ctrl+D` (Linux/macOS) or `Ctrl+Z` then Enter (Windows).

## REPL vs. Python Files: When to Use Each

| Use REPL When...        | Use Files When...               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Testing quick ideas     | Writing complete programs       |
| Learning new syntax     | Creating reusable code          |
| Debugging small pieces  | Working with multiple functions |
| Performing calculations | Saving your work for later      |
| Exploring libraries     | Collaborating with others       |

## Practical Exercise

Open your REPL and try this step-by-step exercise:

```python
# 1. Store your name
>>> name = "Your Name"

# 2. Store your age
>>> age = 25

# 3. Calculate birth year (approximate)
>>> birth_year = 2026 - age

# 4. Create a greeting
>>> greeting = f"Hello, {name}! You were born around {birth_year}."

# 5. Print it
>>> print(greeting)
Hello, Your Name! You were born around 2001.

# 6. Explore the string methods
>>> dir(greeting)

# 7. Try some string methods
>>> greeting.upper()
>>> greeting.lower()
>>> greeting.replace("Hello", "Hi")
```

## Pro Tips for REPL Productivity

### Use Arrow Keys

- **Up/Down arrows**: Navigate through command history
- **Left/Right arrows**: Move cursor in current line

### Import Modules

```python
>>> import math
>>> math.pi
3.141592653589793
>>> math.sqrt(16)
4.0
```

### Clear Variables

To start fresh, just restart the REPL or:

```python
>>> del variable_name
```

**💡 Quick Challenge**: Open your REPL and use `help(len)` to discover what the `len()` function does. Then try it with `len("Python")` and `len([1, 2, 3, 4])`. What do you notice?
