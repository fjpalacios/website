In the previous lesson, you learned what programming is and why Python is the ideal language to start with. Now it's time to **get hands-on** and prepare your computer so you can write and execute Python code.

Don't worry if you have no technical experience: I'll explain step by step how to install everything you need. By the end of this lesson, you'll have executed your first program.

## What are we going to install?

To program in Python, you need three things:

1. **Python** (the language itself)
2. **asdf** (a version manager that makes Python installation easier)
3. **VS Code** (a professional and free code editor)

### Why asdf?

You could install Python directly from python.org, but **asdf is the professional way** to manage Python versions (and other languages). It allows you to:

- Install multiple Python versions on your system
- Switch between versions easily
- Keep your system clean and organized

It's what professional developers use, and the sooner you get used to it, the better.

## Step 1: Installing asdf

### On macOS or Linux

Open your terminal and execute these commands one by one:

```bash
# Clone the asdf repository
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.14.0

# Add asdf to your shell (bash)
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash"' >> ~/.bashrc

# If you use zsh instead of bash:
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'fpath=(${ASDF_DIR}/completions $fpath)' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'autoload -Uz compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Close and reopen your terminal for the changes to take effect.

**Verify the installation:**

```bash
asdf --version
```

You should see something like: `v0.14.0`

### On Windows

On Windows, the easiest way is to use **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux). WSL allows you to run Linux inside Windows, and it's the standard way to develop in Python on Windows.

1. Open PowerShell as administrator and execute:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

2. Restart your computer when prompted
3. Once restarted, an Ubuntu terminal will open. Set up a username and password
4. Now follow the macOS/Linux instructions above

**Important note**: Once you have WSL installed, you'll always work from the Ubuntu terminal (not from PowerShell or CMD). It's a complete Linux environment inside Windows.

## Step 2: Installing Python with asdf

Now that you have asdf, let's install Python. Execute these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the Python plugin to asdf
asdf plugin add python

# Install Python 3.12 (latest stable version)
asdf install python 3.12.4

# Set Python 3.12.4 as the global version (asdf 0.18+)
asdf set --home python 3.12.4
```

The installation may take a few minutes. Be patient.

**Verify the installation:**

```bash
python --version
```

You should see: `Python 3.12.4` (or the version you installed).

Also verify that `pip` (Python's package manager) is available:

```bash
pip --version
```

Perfect. You now have Python running.

## Step 3: Installing VS Code

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is the world's most popular code editor. It's free, powerful, and has thousands of extensions.

### Installation

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download the version for your operating system
3. Install like any other program

### Configuration for Python

Once you have VS Code installed, install the official Python extension:

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the extensions icon (square with puzzle pieces) on the left sidebar
3. Search for "Python"
4. Install the **Python** extension by Microsoft (the one with the most downloads)

This extension provides you with:

- Syntax highlighting
- Intelligent autocomplete
- Real-time error detection
- Code execution from the editor

## Step 4: Your first program

The moment has arrived. Let's write your first Python program.

### Create a file

1. Open VS Code
2. Create a folder for your Python projects (for example: `~/python-course`)
3. Open that folder in VS Code: `File > Open Folder`
4. Create a new file: `File > New File`
5. Save it with the name `hello.py` (the `.py` extension indicates it's a Python file)

### Write the code

In the `hello.py` file, write:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Run the program

There are several ways to run Python code in VS Code:

**Option 1: Integrated terminal**

1. Open VS Code's integrated terminal: `View > Terminal` (or `Ctrl + ñ`)
2. Execute: `python hello.py`

**Option 2: Run button**

1. Click the ▶️ (Play) button that appears in the top right corner
2. Select "Run Python File in Terminal"

You should see in the terminal:

```
Hello, World!
```

**Congratulations! You've written and executed your first Python program.**

## Understanding `print()`

The code you just wrote is extremely simple, but there are important concepts:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

- **`print()`** is a Python **function** that displays text on the screen
- **`"Hello, World!"`** is a **string** (text string) - it always goes in quotes
- The parentheses `()` are necessary to call the function

Let's experiment a bit more. Modify your `hello.py` file:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python programming!")
print("This is my first program.")
```

Run again. You'll see that each `print()` displays its text on a new line.

### Testing with different texts

Now try this:

```python
print("My name is [YOUR NAME]")
print("I am learning Python")
print("Python is awesome!")
```

Replace `[YOUR NAME]` with your actual name and run the program.

## Common troubleshooting

### "python: command not found"

If when running `python --version` it says the command is not found:

1. Verify that asdf is correctly installed: `asdf --version`
2. Verify that Python is installed: `asdf list python`
3. Make sure you've restarted the terminal after installing asdf

### "SyntaxError" when running code

If you see an error like:

```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Check that:

- Quotes are correctly closed: `"text"`
- Parentheses are balanced: `print(...)`
- You haven't forgotten any symbol

### VS Code doesn't find Python

If VS Code says it can't find Python:

1. Open the Command Palette: `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac)
2. Search for "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Select the Python version you installed with asdf

### Note about `asdf set --home` vs `asdf set`

In this course we use `asdf set --home python 3.12.4` to make Python available **globally** on your system. This creates a `~/.tool-versions` file in your home folder.

If in the future you work on projects that need specific Python versions, you can use `asdf set python X.Y.Z` (without `--home`) inside the project directory. This creates a local `.tool-versions` file that only affects that project.

**For this course, don't worry about this.** The global configuration is enough.

## Summary

In this lesson you have:

✅ Installed asdf (professional version manager)  
✅ Installed Python 3.12 with asdf  
✅ Configured VS Code with the Python extension  
✅ Written and executed your first Python program  
✅ Learned to use the `print()` function

**You now have everything you need to continue learning Python.** In the next lesson, we'll start with the fundamentals: variables and data types.

## Practical exercise

Before continuing, make sure your environment works correctly:

1. Create a new file called `test.py`
2. Write a program that displays 5 lines of text with information about you (name, city, hobby, etc.)
3. Run the program and verify that everything works

**Example expected output:**

```
My name is Alice
I live in Madrid
I love playing guitar
I am 25 years old
I want to become a Python developer
```

If you've managed to run this program without errors, **you're ready for the next lesson**.
