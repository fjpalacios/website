We've created [Our First Commit with Git](/en/article/getting-started-with-git/) following our steps, but now we going to learn what really happened.

Git has three basic states, which are: **committed**, **modified** and **staged**. After you **commit** changes and you have your modifications ready, you can relax then because all your changes are safe in Git's timeline, when the state is **modified** Git recognizes a change in the files but they aren't _committed_ and **staged** means the **actual modifications** of the files are in the _queue_ but they are not _committed_.

Note: by **actual modifications** I mean the modifications you did to the file(s) before adding them to the queue, if you don't _tell_ Git you want to submit any new changes you do after the first _commit_, Git is going to submit the file(s) "as it was/as they were" when you told Git to add the file(s) to the queue in the first place.

Let's start with the fun part, we are going to use `git status`, which can be familiar to some of you because we used it in the last part of this course.

```bash
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

As you can see, the output we get is really straight forward, the _working tree is clean_, in other words, there's no file(s) to be _committed_. _Why is this happening to me?_ Because the only file we have in our _repository_ didn't suffer any changes so... let's sort this out. :P

Okay, remember `index.html`? We are going to modify it, just a simple change, adding the following _snippet_ just before the`<h1>`.

```html
<p>Would you like to get ninja level in Git?</p>
```

What about another `git status`?

```bash
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Knowledge is priceless, right? Now _Changes not staged for commit_ sounds a bit better for us now, but we didn't told Git we want to _commit_ the changes, let's do it with `git add index.html`.

```bash
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   index.html
```

We have the **actual version** _staged_ and ready for _commit_, what about adding some spice to our HTML? Just an extension of the last line we just added.

```html
<p>Would you like to get ninja level in Git? Stay tuned to our course!</p>
```

As you can see we just added _Stay tuned to our course!_ which would be the pride of all the Marketing Experts to be honest but what happens now with `git status`?

```bash
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   index.html
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html
```

As we said before, we have everything ready for our next **commit**, but with the changes we realized to our file, Git (who is a _smart-y_ pants) knows the actual file has been modified again. At this point, there's two options, we are aware of this and we _add_ the next modifications for the _commit_ with a simple `git add index.html` or, just do the _commit_ like we are going to do now which is going to show us why using a version control software helps a lot, let's _commit_ our file to the repository with `git commit -m "Adding a striking message"`.

```bash
[master f7c5eba] Adding a striking message
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

And once again, let's see what `git status` has to say

```bash
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We're in trouble now… we just send our _commit_ but without the latest changes, don't worry, thanks to Git we can solve this (at least for now…). If we didn't _committed_ any more changes but the last one, we can _revert_ this, first, with `git add index.html` and after just a simple `git commit --amend`, the text editor (hopefully is vim…) we selected in the start of this course will open the next text.

```bash
Adding a striking message

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Tue Nov 7 20:02:01 2017 +0100
#
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   index.html
```

The first part is the message we added to the _commit_, in case you added a wrong _commit_ message feel free to change it now and finally, save the file and…

```bash
[master e02c63c] Adding a striking message
 Date: Tue Nov 7 20:02:01 2017 +0100
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

If you are into details, you can see the **ID** for the _commit_ changed from **f7c5eba** to **e02c63c**, because even when we _revert_ a _commit_, Git knows there was a _commit_ realized just before this one and it gives another **ID** for the "same file" _commit_.

This is it, as the people usually say, remember, you can check [Our GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sargantanacode) where you can find the [repository for this course](https://github.com/sargantanacode/git-tutorial) with all the steps and lessons we do in here :)

And never… ever… stop programming!
