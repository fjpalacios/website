In the previous lessons you already know what Python is, you have your environment set up, and you've written your first program with `print()`. Now it's time to take the next step: **learn to store and manipulate information**.

Imagine you're writing a video game. You need to save the player's score, their name, whether they have lives remaining... That's what **variables** are for: containers where you store information that can change while your program runs.

## What is a variable?

A variable is a **name you give to a piece of data** so you can use it later. Think of it as a labeled box where you store something.

```python
name = "Ana"
age = 25
score = 1500
```

You just created three variables:

- `name` contains the text `"Ana"`
- `age` contains the number `25`
- `score` contains the number `1500`

### Creating a variable

In Python, creating a variable is as simple as writing a name, the `=` sign, and the value you want to store:

```python
message = "Hello, world"
```

You don't need to declare the data type (like in other languages). Python is smart enough to know that `"Hello, world"` is text.

### Using a variable

Once created, you can use the variable by writing its name:

```python
name = "Carlos"
print(name)  # Prints: Carlos

age = 30
print(age)   # Prints: 30
```

You can also use variables inside operations:

```python
price = 50
discount = 10
total = price - discount
print(total)  # Prints: 40
```

### Variables can change

That's where the name comes from: they're _variable_. You can change their value at any time:

```python
counter = 0
print(counter)  # Prints: 0

counter = 1
print(counter)  # Prints: 1

counter = 100
print(counter)  # Prints: 100
```

## Rules for naming variables

Python has some strict rules (and others that are good practices):

### Mandatory rules

1. **Only letters, numbers, and underscores**: You can't use spaces or special symbols

   ```python
   full_name = "Ana Garcia"  # ✅ Correct
   full-name = "Ana Garcia"  # ❌ Error
   full name = "Ana Garcia"  # ❌ Error
   ```

2. **Can't start with a number**

   ```python
   age1 = 25      # ✅ Correct
   1age = 25      # ❌ Error
   ```

3. **You can't use Python reserved words** (`if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, etc.)
   ```python
   for = 5         # ❌ Error (for is a reserved word)
   my_for = 5      # ✅ Correct
   ```

### Good practices (conventions)

1. **Use snake_case**: lowercase words separated by underscores

   ```python
   user_name = "Ana"      # ✅ Preferred in Python
   userName = "Ana"       # ❌ Works but not pythonic
   UserName = "Ana"       # ❌ This is reserved for classes
   ```

2. **Descriptive names**: make it clear what the variable contains

   ```python
   user_age = 25           # ✅ Clear
   a = 25                  # ❌ What is "a"?

   discounted_price = 45   # ✅ Descriptive
   dp = 45                 # ❌ Too short
   ```

3. **In English (recommended)**: facilitates international collaboration
   ```python
   user_age = 25           # ✅ Recommended
   ```

## Basic data types

When you create a variable, Python automatically assigns it a **data type** depending on the value you give it. The three most important types to start with are:

### 1. Integers (int)

Numbers without decimals. Used for counting, indexes, ages, scores...

```python
age = 25
players = 4
year = 2026
temperature = -5
```

You can do mathematical operations with them:

```python
sum = 10 + 5        # 15
subtraction = 10 - 5       # 5
multiplication = 10 * 5    # 50
division = 10 / 5    # 2.0 (note: result is float)
floor_division = 10 // 3  # 3 (integer division, discards decimals)
remainder = 10 % 3       # 1 (remainder of division)
power = 2 ** 3    # 8 (2 to the power of 3)
```

### 2. Floating point numbers (float)

Numbers with decimals. Used for measurements, prices, percentages...

```python
price = 19.99
temperature = 36.5
percentage = 0.15
```

**Important**: In Python you use the **dot** (`.`) as decimal separator, not the comma:

```python
price = 19.99   # ✅ Correct
price = 19,99   # ❌ This creates a tuple, not a number
```

Operations with floats:

```python
total = 10.5 + 2.3   # 12.8
half = 10.0 / 2      # 5.0
```

When you mix `int` and `float`, the result is always `float`:

```python
result = 10 + 2.5    # 12.5 (float)
```

### 3. Text strings (str)

Any text goes between quotes. You can use single quotes `'...'` or double quotes `"..."`, it doesn't matter:

```python
name = "Ana"
surname = 'Garcia'
message = "Hello, world"
```

**Tip**: Use double quotes by default. Only use single quotes when you need double quotes inside the text:

```python
phrase = 'She said: "Hello"'
```

#### Concatenating strings

You can join texts with the `+` operator:

```python
name = "Ana"
surname = "Garcia"
full_name = name + " " + surname
print(full_name)  # Ana Garcia
```

#### f-strings: the modern way to format text

Since Python 3.6 there's a much more comfortable way to include variables inside text: **f-strings** (formatted strings). Put an `f` before the quotes and write the variables inside `{}`:

```python
name = "Carlos"
age = 30

# Old way (works but ugly)
message = "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old"

# Modern way with f-strings (much better!)
message = f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old"
print(message)  # Hello, my name is Carlos and I am 30 years old
```

You can do operations inside the curly braces:

```python
price = 100
discount = 20
print(f"Final price: {price - discount} euros")  # Final price: 80 euros
```

### 4. Booleans (bool)

Can only have two values: `True` (true) or `False` (false). Used for conditions, decisions, states...

```python
is_adult = True
has_won = False
has_discount = True
```

**Important**: `True` and `False` start with a **capital letter**. It's mandatory:

```python
active = True    # ✅ Correct
active = true    # ❌ Error (NameError)
```

Booleans usually come from comparisons:

```python
age = 25
is_adult = age >= 18    # True

temperature = 15
is_cold = temperature < 20    # True

points = 100
has_won = points >= 150       # False
```

## Checking the type of a variable

If you're not sure of a variable's data type, use `type()`:

```python
name = "Ana"
print(type(name))    # <class 'str'>

age = 25
print(type(age))      # <class 'int'>

price = 19.99
print(type(price))    # <class 'float'>

active = True
print(type(active))    # <class 'bool'>
```

This is especially useful when debugging code and you want to understand what's happening.

## Converting between types

Sometimes you need to convert one data type to another. Python has functions for that:

### str() — Convert to text

```python
age = 25
age_text = str(age)
print("I am " + age_text + " years old")  # I am 25 years old
```

Or better with f-strings (which does the conversion automatically):

```python
age = 25
print(f"I am {age} years old")  # I am 25 years old
```

### int() — Convert to integer

```python
price_text = "100"
price = int(price_text)
print(price + 50)  # 150
```

⚠️ **Careful**: If you try to convert something that isn't a number, Python will throw an error:

```python
number = int("abc")  # ValueError: invalid literal for int()
```

### float() — Convert to decimal

```python
price_text = "19.99"
price = float(price_text)
print(price)  # 19.99
```

### bool() — Convert to boolean

```python
number = 5
is_true = bool(number)
print(is_true)  # True
```

**Important rule**: In Python, `0`, `""` (empty string), `None`, empty lists `[]` and empty dictionaries `{}` are considered `False`. Everything else is `True`:

```python
bool(0)      # False
bool(1)      # True
bool(-5)     # True
bool("")     # False
bool("Hi")   # True
```

## Practical exercise

Open your REPL (type `python` in the terminal) and try this step by step:

```python
# 1. Create variables with personal information
>>> name = "Your Name"
>>> age = 25
>>> height = 1.75  # in meters
>>> student = True

# 2. Display the information
>>> print(f"Name: {name}")
>>> print(f"Age: {age} years")
>>> print(f"Height: {height} meters")
>>> print(f"Is a student? {student}")

# 3. Do calculations
>>> birth_year = 2026 - age
>>> print(f"Approximate birth year: {birth_year}")

# 4. Check types
>>> print(type(name))
>>> print(type(age))
>>> print(type(height))
>>> print(type(student))

# 5. Convert data
>>> age_text = str(age)
>>> print("I am " + age_text + " years old")

# 6. Experiment with operations
>>> discount = 20
>>> original_price = 100
>>> final_price = original_price - (original_price * discount / 100)
>>> print(f"Original price: {original_price}€")
>>> print(f"Discount: {discount}%")
>>> print(f"Final price: {final_price}€")
```

## Key concepts from this lesson

- **Variables** are named containers for storing data
- Use **snake_case** and descriptive names for your variables
- **Basic data types** are: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- **f-strings** (`f"Text {variable}"`) are the modern way to format text
- Use `type()` to check a variable's type
- You can convert types with `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`

## Next steps

In the next lesson we'll learn about **operators and expressions**: how to do more complex calculations, compare values, and combine conditions. It's the foundation for making decisions in your code.

**💡 Challenge**: Create a program in a file `calculator.py` that:

1. Stores two numbers in variables
2. Calculates sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division
3. Displays the results with f-strings in a clear way

Example output:

```
Number 1: 10
Number 2: 3
Sum: 13
Subtraction: 7
Multiplication: 30
Division: 3.33
```

Never stop coding!
